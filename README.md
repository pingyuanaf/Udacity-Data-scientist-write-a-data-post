## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.8.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Stack Overflow data from 2018-2020 to better understand:

1. What's most pouplar language that among last 3 year?
2. What's rapid growing language that among last 3 year?
3. What's depreciated langauge that among last 3 year?

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

The notebook available here showcases work related to the above questions.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://pingyuan0626.medium.com/whats-most-welcome-language-among-developer-based-on-the-stackoverflow-survey-data-138b72faa9cf).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

Must give credit to Stack Overflow for the data.  You can find the Licensing for the data and other descriptive information at the link available [here](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey).  Otherwise, feel free to use the code here as you would like!
